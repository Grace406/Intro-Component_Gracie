## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

*I learned to use the ':root' element better.
*It was tough at first figuring out how to use the warning fill in my HTML but with the help of chatGPT, I was  able to apply it to my project.
*One more thing I learned is that projects truly build experience, doing this project has motivated me to do more Front-end mentor projects not to procastinate or feel like an imposter but to sharpen my skills and prepare myself for the job market! 

These are some lines I am proud of: 

```html
              <i class="ri-error-warning-fill"></i>

```
```css
body{
    background-color: var(--primary-red);
    background-color: var(--primary-red);
    color: #fff;
    background-image: url(images/bg-intro-desktop.png);
    min-height: 100vh;
    font-family: 'Poppins';
    display: grid;
    place-content: center;
}
```
```js
 if(isValid) {
        alert('Form submitted successfully!')
    }
```

### Continued development

I'd love to get into more effective css practices and use JavaScript more effectively.
